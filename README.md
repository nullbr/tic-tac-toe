## Command Line Game

Tic Tac Toe is a classic game implemented in Ruby and played through the command line interface. The game was developed using Test Driven Development techniques, with automated tests written in RSpec.

The game offers three different modes: Human vs Human, Human vs Computer, and Computer vs Computer. Additionally, you can choose between two difficulty levels for the computer player: "Noobie" and "Professional".

## Installation and Setup

To set up the game, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the setup script:

```bash
$ bin/setup
```

## How to Play

To start playing the game, run the following command:

```bash
$ bin/play
```

Follow the on-screen instructions to select the game mode, enter player names, and make moves on the board.

## Running Tests

If you wish to run the automated tests, execute the following command:

```bash
$ rspec
```

This will run the RSpec test suite and display the test results.

Feel free to explore and enjoy the Tic Tac Toe game!
